# wgpu-test
This is a test project to try out graphics with wGPU. Eventually I want to bring this into game-of-life and create a GUI for interacting with it.
Hopefully this project also helps when making any future Rust projects.

First tutorial I followed: https://zdgeier.com/wgpuintro.html
That one ended up not being too helpful, so I moved back to the traditional (and good)
learn wgpu tutorial (from the wpgu website)
